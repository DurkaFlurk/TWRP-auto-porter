STEPS:
Unpack your TWRP recovery by dragging the recovery.img onto unpackimg.bat within the Android image kitchen tool's folder
Copy the downloaded libminutwrp.so file into the folder /ramdisk/sbin and if requested, overwrite the existing file
Repack the TWRP by double clicking repackimg.bat
Flash, test and confirm if the new TWRP (image-new.img) has it's displayed fixed


There's no guarantees that this works for all devices / chipset type, you'd have to test it yourself to find out. So far it's worked on two different mediatek chipset types i.e MT6580 & MT6737
This might work for other devices with TWRP rotated at 270 degrees, but you'll need to find a fixed TWRP, unpack it and copy the libminutwrp.so from within /ramdisk/sbin folder and try it on your TWRP

in this video tutorial, i'm going to be showing how to fix twrp recovery rotated at 180 degrees
now i have here a phone and you can see the hardware buttons down here but you can see twrp's buttons up and everything is inverted
now notice that normally install should be here and reboot should be here, if i click install i'll get reboot, which means that the display has been rotated to 180 degrees
now to fix this we are going to need a tool for unpacking the recovery
you can download android image kitchen then you'll your twrp recovery and you'll need this file from another device with this same problem but has a twrp that has been fixed
so basically you need a phone that has it's twrp fixed to display correctly. so in my case i already have the file
we are going to be sharing this file, the link will be in the description
so lets begin, we'll simply drag and drop recovery to unpack
now locate ramdisk, sbin, then copy this file into sbin folder, of course we'll have to replace the existing file
this is the name of the file just incase
then we go back and we'll repack
and we'll have our new image, so i'm going to quickly flash this to the phone
let me reboot to bootloader, which means here then bootloader should be nope..
well, this device has it's hardware button stuck
i'm currently trying to boot to fastboot mode, so i'll quickly launch powershell window
nope, not yet, we need to wait for the phone to boot properly
okay, now i connect it again
so my device is in fastboot mode but you can't see it because the screen is blurred
i see what happened
okay then i reboot to recovery mode
well, there you go, you can see that the screen is fixed, the display rather
now from here you can see when i click install, i get install and everything is how it should normally be
so guys that's how you fix twrp rotated screen, i don't know if this works on every device but you test and tell us
